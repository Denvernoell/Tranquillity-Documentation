# Dashboard

- Dashboard created using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- This runs on Streamlit Cloud and reads from the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database
- Plots use [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
    - This allows for interactive plots that can be zoomed in on
    - Options at the top should allow for changing the points used in the plot
